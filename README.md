### Run_the_game

To play you can use ``make`` or ``make all`` to generate _so_long_ file, then you can execute it with one of map as a parametr:

**``./so_long maps/any_map``**

All of makefile rules:

| Rule | Function |
| - | - |
| ``make`` | Generete game without enemies |
| ``make all`` | Same as just make |
| ``make bonus`` | Generete game with enemies and some animation|
| ``make clean`` | Deletes all object files |
| ``make fclean`` | Deletes the object files and the _solong_ file |
| ``make re`` | makes ``fclean`` and ``make`` again (without enemies) |

``there could be warnings while creating _so_long_ file, but they are on the conscience of the developers :)``

### Game_rules

The main idea of the game is very simple: all you have to do is collect all "booze" bottles and reach 24-hours liquor store!
You can't escape without collecting all of the bottles. If you play ``bonus`` vesrion there are police patrols cars, you should avoid.

### Control

#### Control
Control buttons is classic ``WASD`` to move and ``esc`` to close window.

### Maps

All my maps are stored in ``maps`` folder. All of them are playable, except ``map_inv.ber``.

#### Map symbols meaning
| Symbol | Meaning |
| - | - |
| ``1`` | The wall |
| ``0`` | Empty space |
| ``C`` | Collectable item |
| ``P`` | Start |
| ``E`` | Finish |
